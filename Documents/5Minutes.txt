I start up the game and click new game, I'm greeted by a top secret folder with prompting for my name and the name of my company. 
I choose the name "Bond" And the company name "Super Spy Inc". The folder opens on the first page and A message is written to me by me, the Bond me. 
He's saying that I'm starting up a spy company and It's time to go on a mission. One of the tabs on the side labeled "Mission" flashes so I tap it. 
It opens on another page where there is one mission available, I guess I choose that one. 
A page with two tabs at the top shows me details of the mission, It says things like The name and description of the mission "Set up an office" 
"We'll be needing a place to stage operations from, To IKEA! - Bond" Beneath that it says one agent is required, And that "Mum's car" is the only asset needed. 
No skills are required, which is nice because I don't think I have any and it will take 10 seconds, that's a quick trip. 
At the bottom there is a button saying "select agent" I pick that and the only agent is Bond, so I'll pick him and confirm. 
Off he goes, Time to wait some seconds, Ok he's back and I've got a summary of the job "I've got the desk and chair and am setting it up in the basement, 
Now if we can get dad's mini-fridge in here the base will be complete".
